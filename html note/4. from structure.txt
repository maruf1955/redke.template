Froms Pages: We can use <form> attributes:


we have to write class and action tag inside the <form> attributes.

1. class=""

2. action=""---It defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

3. we can write the another tag which is "target".It is responsibel when submitting this form, the result will be opend in a new browser tab:
	example: <form action="" target="_blank">

4. Another tag we can write inside the <form> attributes which is " method="" ".

	example: <form action="" method="get"> or <form action="" method="post">

explain: It is specifies the http method to be used when submittion form data.The form data 

	can be sent as URL variables(with method="post") or as http post transaction (with 	ethod="post")

Notes on GET:

Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:

Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!


5. Another is "autocomplete="on" tag.

example: form action="" autocomplete="on or off">

explain: It is specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.When autocomplete is onm the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.

## There are some input types these are given below......
 
example: <label for="username">username:</label>
        <input id="username" type="username" name="" value="" placeholder="Md Maruf Khan" 	required><br><br>

        <input id="password" type="password" name="" vale="" placeholder="aNf@125F" 	required <br><br><br>
      <label for="date">date:</label>
